# Creating your first Aavegotchi Farm

## The basics

To create a farm, you need an Aavegotchi Realm Parcel. Which can be found on the Aavegotchi Baazaar at [https://aavegotchi.com/baazaar/realm](https://aavegotchi.com/baazaar/realm).

Farms are limited to one per wallet address. A farm is destroyed upon removal from the farm contract.

To create a farm, the chosen Realm Parcel is sent to the farm contract in addition to a non-refundable creation fee of .01 GHST. The farm contract will be in possesion of the Reaalm Parcel and can be withdrawn if no Aavegotchi is held on the farm. Withdrawing the Reaalm Parcel from the contract will close the farm.

Up to 4 Aavegotchis can be sent by the farm owner to the farm contract in order to protect the farm. A flat fee of 0.01 GHST is applied for each Aavegotchi sent to and from the farm contract.

The fees applied are in place so as to negate spamming the Polygon network and applied towards development, promotion, and player rewards chosen by firstaavegotchi.eth and the community.

All  Aavegotchis in the farm contract will be automatically pet as they are happy working hard on the farm with their frens!

Once you have a farm and equipped gotchis in the contract you can start to play by attacking the neighbouring farms. But be careful because you can also be attacked by the neighbouring farms!

In order to attack the neighbouring farms you need an equipped Cowboy Gotchi on the farm.
