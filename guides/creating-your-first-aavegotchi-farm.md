# Creating your first Aavegotchi Farm

## The basics

To create a farm, you need to own a Realm Parcel. If you do not own one such parcel, you can buy one from the Aavegotchi Baazaar [https://aavegotchi.com/baazaar/realm](https://aavegotchi.com/baazaar/realm).

Only one farm per address can be owned at one point in time. A farm is destroyed when the last Realm Parcel is removed from the farm.

To create a farm, you need to pay the farm creation flat fee and send the Realm Parcel to the farm contract. The farm contract will be the owner of that Realm Parcel. The parcel can be withdrawn if there is no Aavegotchi in the farm. Withdrawing the Realm Parcel from the farm will destroy the farm.

A flat fee of 0.01 GHST is paid for each farm creation. 100% of the generated revenue from the farm creation is sent to the firstaavegotchi.eth wallet, the creator of the game. This fee is non-refundable.

A maximum of 4 Aavegotchies can be sent to the farm contract to protect the farm. Only the farm owner can send the Aavegotchies. A flat fee of 0.01 GHST is paid for each Aavegotchi sent to the farm. 100% of the generated revenue from the Aavegotchies being added to the farm is sent to the firstaavegotchi.eth wallet, the creator of the game. This fee is non-refundable.

At any time, the farm owner can withdraw the Aavegotchies from the farm. A flat fee of 0.01 GHST is paid for each Aavegotchi withdrawn from the farm. 100% of the generated revenue from the Aavegotchies being withdrawn from the farm is sent to the firstaavegotchi.eth wallet, the creator of the game. This fee is non-refundable.

These three fees are in place so that players do not spam the Polygon network. In the future, these fees can be used also for game promotion or player rewards.

All the Aavegotchies in the farm contract are automatically pet.

Once you have a farm and gotchies added, you can attack the neighbouring farms. At the same time, your farm can be attacked by the neighbouring farms.

The requirement to be able to attack the neighbouring farms is to have a Cowboy Aavegotchi in the farm.
